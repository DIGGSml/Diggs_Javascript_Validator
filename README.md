To use the DIGGS File Validator and Viewer, follow these simple steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Locate the HTML file (diggs-validator.html) in the repository.
Double-click on the HTML file to open it in your default web browser.
Upon opening the HTML file, it will automatically perform validation on the embedded DIGGS file and display the results.

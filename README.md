# DIGGS File Validator and Viewer

Welcome to the DIGGS File Validator and Viewer! This standalone tool is designed to simplify the process of validating and viewing DIGGS (Drilling Information Geotechnical Geoscience Standards) files. It provides a user-friendly way to check the validity and explore the contents of any DIGGS file, including drilling data, MWD (Measurement While Drilling), CPT (Cone Penetration Testing), and more.

## Features

- Standalone HTML file that can be used offline
- Automatic validation of DIGGS files
- Interactive tree view for easy navigation and exploration of DIGGS file contents
- Support for various types of DIGGS files (drilling data, MWD, CPT, etc.)
- Seamless integration of the original DIGGS file within the HTML wrapper
- User-friendly interface for a smooth experience

## Usage

To use the DIGGS File Validator and Viewer, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Locate the HTML file (`diggs-validator.html`) in the repository.
3. Double-click on the HTML file to open it in your default web browser.

Upon opening the HTML file, it will automatically perform validation on the embedded DIGGS file and display the results. If the DIGGS file is valid, you will see a success message, and an interactive tree view will be generated, allowing you to easily navigate and explore the contents of the DIGGS file.

## Customization

To validate and view your own DIGGS files using this tool, follow these steps:

1. Open the HTML file (`diggs-validator.html`) in a text editor.
2. Locate the `xmlContent` variable in the JavaScript section of the HTML file.
3. Replace the existing DIGGS XML content with your own DIGGS file content.
4. Save the modified HTML file.

Now, when you open the modified HTML file in a web browser, it will validate and display your custom DIGGS file.
